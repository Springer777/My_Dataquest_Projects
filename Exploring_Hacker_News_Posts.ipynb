    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker news is a site started by the startup incubator Y combinator, where user-submitted stories or posts receive votes and comments. Posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors. The dataset can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main purpose of this project\n",
    "Our focus in this project is on the posts with the titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Under Ask HN, users ask the Hacker News community a specific question such as: \"How to improve my website?\", \"Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\". Show HN shows users' submission of a project, product or just something interesting such as \"Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our task here is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n"

    "Based on this observations, it is recommended for a user to create an Ask HN post within this time in order to have a higher chance of receiving as many comments as possible. However, it should be noted that additional factors such as the exact topic, content, and audience of the post can also influence the number of comments received so it doesn't mean that we will always get the most comments if we publish at 15:00 ET (7 pm GMT). Nevertheless, the chances are higher to receive most comments in that time and therefore the analysis can be used as strategy for creating content on the Hacker News website.\n",
