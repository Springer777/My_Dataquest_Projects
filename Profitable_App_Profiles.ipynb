    "To minimize risks and overhead, our **validation strategy** for an app idea has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "2. If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.\n",
    "3. If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our end goal is to add the app on both Google Play and the App Store, we need to find app profiles that are successful in both markets. For instance, a profile that works well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.\n",

After inspection of both data sets,  we'll build a frequency table for the *prime_genre* column of the App Store data set, and for the *Genres* and *Category* columns of the Google Play data set."

    "In addition to communication apps, video player apps, social apps, photography apps, and productivity apps exhibit the same pattern. Moreover, these niches seem to be dominated by a few giants who are hard to compete against. Games genre seem pretty popular but a bit saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next niches we could consider are 'news and magazine' and 'book and reference' genres which looks fairly popular as well, with an avergae number of installs of 9,549,178 and 8,767,811 respectively. Since we have already found that the Book and Reference genre shows a plausibility of working well on the App Store, and our aim to recommend an app that shows potential to generate profit on both the App Store and Google Play, we will consider that genre next."
